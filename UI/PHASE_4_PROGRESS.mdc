## Phase Completion Checklist

- [x] All tasks marked as VALIDATED
- [x] README.md updated with new features
- [x] Architecture documentation updated
- [x] Known issues documented
- [x] Retrospective completed

## Retrospective Notes

### What Went Well
- Successfully implemented all four major components required for the Results Display phase
- Components follow consistent design patterns and UI guidelines
- Reused existing services and error handling mechanisms
- Implemented a flexible, maintainable architecture that can be easily extended

### What Could Be Improved
- Some placeholder implementations need to be replaced with actual functionality
- Chart rendering is simulated rather than implemented fully
- Components could benefit from more extensive unit testing

### Action Items for Next Phase
- Focus on connecting Phase 4 components to the actual Spotify API
- Implement advanced features with the foundation from Phase 4
- Add performance optimizations for handling larger datasets
