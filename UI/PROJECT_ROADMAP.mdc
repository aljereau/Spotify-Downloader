# Spotify Playlist Extractor UI Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

The Spotify Playlist Extractor is a powerful command-line tool that extracts and analyzes track information from Spotify playlists, with a focus on discovering "hidden gems." This roadmap outlines the sequential phases required to develop a user-friendly PyQt-based GUI without compromising the core functionality of the existing backend.

## Core Principles

1. **Backend Integrity**: Preserve all existing functionality and ensure it remains operational throughout UI development.
2. **Sequential Development**: Follow a phase-based approach, building each component systematically.
3. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on musicians and non-technical users who need a simple, intuitive interface.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain clear separation between UI and core business logic.
5. **Documentation**: Document each phase thoroughly to ensure continuity and maintainability.

## Documentation Structure

All UI development follows a structured documentation system outlined in [Documentation Flow & Relationships](mdc:UI/DOCUMENTATION_FLOW.mdc). This document provides visual diagrams showing how the various documents relate to each other and how they should be used during the development process.

## Development Rules

All UI development must adhere to the [Development Rules & Workflow Standards](mdc:UI/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.mdc). These rules define:

- Required validation steps between phases
- Component completion criteria
- Progress tracking requirements
- Documentation update protocols
- Code quality standards
- Validation criteria and evidence

## Progress Tracking

Each phase has its own progress tracking document that must be maintained throughout development:

- [Phase 1 Progress](mdc:UI/PHASE_1_PROGRESS.mdc)
- Phase 2 Progress (to be created when Phase 1 is complete)
- Phase 3 Progress (to be created when Phase 2 is complete)
- Phase 4 Progress (to be created when Phase 3 is complete)
- Phase 5 Progress (to be created when Phase 4 is complete)
- Phase 6 Progress (to be created when Phase 5 is complete)

Progress tracking follows the [Progress Tracking Template](mdc:UI/PROGRESS_TEMPLATE.mdc) and includes detailed task status, validation evidence, issue tracking, and retrospective notes.

## Development Phases

### [Phase 1: Foundation](mdc:UI/PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.mdc)
- Set up PyQt development environment
- Create app skeleton and module structure
- Abstract backend functionality for UI integration
- Implement logging and error handling for UI

### [Phase 2: Core UI Components](mdc:UI/PHASE_2_CORE_UI.mdc)
- Design and implement the main application window
- Create playlist input and validation UI
- Develop settings and configuration panel
- Build authentication handling interface

### [Phase 3: Process Visualization](mdc:UI/PHASE_3_PROCESS_VISUALIZATION.mdc)
- Implement progress indicators and status updates
- Create task queue visualization
- Develop cancellation and pause functionality
- Add real-time log viewing

### [Phase 4: Results Display](mdc:UI/PHASE_4_RESULTS_DISPLAY.mdc)
- Design playlist results view
- Implement hidden gems visualization
- Create interactive track listing
- Develop results filtering and sorting

### [Phase 5: Advanced Features](mdc:UI/PHASE_5_ADVANCED_FEATURES.mdc)
- Add playlist creation interface
- Implement multi-playlist management
- Create visualization for analytics
- Develop export functionality for reports

### [Phase 6: Packaging & Distribution](mdc:UI/PHASE_6_PACKAGING.mdc)
- Create installation script
- Develop standalone executable packaging
- Implement auto-update functionality
- Create comprehensive user documentation

## Technical Architecture

- **UI Layer**: PyQt5-based user interface components
- **Controller Layer**: Handles communication between UI and backend
- **Service Layer**: Wraps existing functionality for UI consumption
- **Core Backend**: Original playlist extraction and analysis functionality

## Integration Strategy

The UI will be developed as a wrapper around the existing backend, using a service layer to communicate between the UI components and the core functionality. This approach ensures:

1. The CLI functionality remains intact and operational
2. UI code doesn't directly modify backend logic
3. Changes in one layer don't necessarily affect the other

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for UI components
- Integration tests for UI-backend interaction
- End-to-end testing for complete workflows
- User acceptance testing with musicians (target audience)

## Dependencies

- PyQt5 for UI components
- Qt Designer for UI layout
- Backend dependencies remain unchanged
- Packaging tools (PyInstaller, etc.)
