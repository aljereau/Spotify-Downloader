## Retrospective Notes

### What Went Well
- Successfully implemented all four major advanced features components
- Created reusable panel components for analytics visualizations
- Implemented clean interfaces for export functionality
- Maintained consistent UI styling across all components
- Developed comprehensive test suite for all components

### What Could Be Improved
- Better error handling for API interactions would enhance robustness
- More real data processing instead of mock implementations
- Performance optimization for handling large playlists could be enhanced
- Integration with cloud services needs more security review

### Action Items for Next Phase
- Review Phase 5 components for any needed refinements during packaging
- Address security concerns for OAuth token handling and cloud storage integration
- Optimize performance for large playlist handling
- Complete proper documentation for all export formats
- Ensure cross-platform UI consistency for all implemented components
